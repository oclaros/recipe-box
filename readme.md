# recipe-box

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate creating a react application. This application will allow the user to add, remove and maintain recipes.

## Motivation
This is based on the FreeCodeCamp challange project called **[Build a Recipe Box](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-recipe-box "Build a Recipe Box")**.

## Prerequisites
You will need to install the following using yarn or npm:
* Either use [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app "create react app") or you will need to setup the React environment yourself. ***Note: I have created a very basic React setup called [barebones-react](https://github.com/oclaros/barebones-react "barebones-react")***

You will need css-loader and styles-loader for webpack to load/inject css
